Visualisations for life expectancy and population statistics

I used a bar chart to compare life expectancy by continent.

This line chart is utilised to compare the trend of life expectancies over time for the five countries with the highest life expectancy statistics.

A pie chart representing gender split, and filterable by country.

A scatter plot compares life expectancy vs BMI.

And another line chart visualises the relationship between life expectancy and population growth in different continents.

These insights are combined on my [interactive dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/views/GlobalHealthDashboard_17604499238770/GlobalHealthInsights?:language=en-GB&:sid=&:redirect=auth&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link) which can be seen on Tableau Public.
